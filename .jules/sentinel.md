## 2024-05-22 - [Timing Attack in Webhook Verification]
**Vulnerability:** The Paystack webhook signature verification used a simple string comparison (`hash === signature`).
**Learning:** String comparison fails early when characters don't match, allowing an attacker to deduce the signature byte-by-byte by measuring response times (timing attack).
**Prevention:** Use `crypto.timingSafeEqual` which compares buffers in constant time regardless of content. Ensure buffers are of equal length before comparison to avoid errors/leaks.
