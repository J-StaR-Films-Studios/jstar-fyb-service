## 2024-05-22 - [Timing Attack in Webhook Verification]
**Vulnerability:** The Paystack webhook signature verification used a simple string comparison (`hash === signature`).
**Learning:** String comparison fails early when characters don't match, allowing an attacker to deduce the signature byte-by-byte by measuring response times (timing attack).
**Prevention:** Use `crypto.timingSafeEqual` which compares buffers in constant time regardless of content. Ensure buffers are of equal length before comparison to avoid errors/leaks.

## 2026-01-14 - [XSS in Mermaid Diagrams]
**Vulnerability:** `DiagramPreview.tsx` initialized Mermaid with `securityLevel: 'loose'`, which allows HTML tags (including `<script>`) in diagram labels.
**Learning:** Third-party visualization libraries often default to or allow insecure configurations that prioritize flexibility over security. When rendering user-controlled content, these defaults can lead to Stored XSS.
**Prevention:** Always explicitly set `securityLevel: 'strict'` (or equivalent) when initializing Mermaid.js or similar libraries if the input can be influenced by users.
